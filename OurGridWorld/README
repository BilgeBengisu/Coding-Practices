1. Installation to support basic usage of Gymnasium:
   https://gymnasium.farama.org/v0.29.0/content/basic_usage/

`pip install gymnasium[box2d]` did not work for me on the Mac.

Something is wrong with the box2d setup that comes with gymnasium
and the pip that comes with python3.13.

I had to (on Mac) uninstall gymnasium, then do the following:

brew install swig
python -m pip install box2d pygame 
python -m pip install --upgrade setuptools
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
python -m pip install gymnasium

2. Installation to support creating a Gymnasium environment:
   https://gymnasium.farama.org/tutorials/gymnasium_basics/environment_creation/

Follow instructions to install pipx. On Mac:
brew install pipx
pipx ensurepath
sudo pipx ensurepath --global # optional to allow pipx actions with --global argument

Then: `pipx install copier` and follow the instructions.
